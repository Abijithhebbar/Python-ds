The executable code is in app7.py
It asks for the user to enter the url and then asks them to select the date.
Once the date is selected the script runs and then the images are downloaded.
If a date is selected images of the days after the date are downloaded.
It is taken care that the images of the days are downloaded in such a way that the images are not re-downloaded.
Dates of which the images are downloaded are stored in sqlite db and then used for the reference.
Url of the day, Date, no.of images are stored in the sqlite db.
all the other python files are demo files on which I have worked
